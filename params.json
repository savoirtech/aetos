{"name":"Aetos - The Microservices Platform","tagline":"Integration built just the way you like it!","body":"### Aetos - The Integration Platform.\r\nAetos is the microservices integration container built on a solid Apache platform.  Its made up of Apache Karaf, Camel, CXF, and ActiveMQ with the latest and most stable versions.  But isn't this Apache Servicemix? Not at all!  We created Aetos to provide a lightwieght container without a lot of extra overhead that includes the proverbial kitchen sink.  We offer several versions of Aetos based on the different major versions of Karaf as a download from Maven Central.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/643609/5669734/7db2fd86-9737-11e4-8f3c-38766ffc9cbb.png)\r\n\r\nThe Aetos code base is a magic maven build that allows you to produce your own integration container with the versions that you need, that are based on the pure Apache implementations of Camel, Karaf, CXF, ActiveMQ, and many others.  No more need to rely on companies who fork Apache code to produce their own stacks and force you to wait for them to give you a patch on thier own time frames.  That is what is called vendor lock in.  With Aetos, you have a stack that is based on pure Apache software (like clean water), ASL Licensed, and the versions that are right for your organization.  Want the latest and greatest all built for you?  They are ready for you to download at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g%3A%22com.savoirtech.aetos%22%20AND%20a%3A%22aetos%22)!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNeed commercial support or help with Aetos?
